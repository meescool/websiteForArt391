# Website For Art 391
This repository contains a dynamic website project I created for my Art 391 course. 
Here is the link to the website: https://marcela-estrada-art391.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies used
I developed it in the NodeJS enviroment, using the Express JS framework and
EJS templates. 

## How to run
In order to run this on your own local server, please make sure to have at least 
Node v17.1.0 installed on your pc. 
Then run this command:
`
npm install
`.
This should install all the dependencies needed for the website. 

## Final notes
Since this is for a course, I will be removing all the images and replace
them with a placeholder.
